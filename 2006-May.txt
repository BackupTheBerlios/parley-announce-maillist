Subject: [Parley-announce] Parley 0.09
Message-ID: <20060511195621.GC11201@herlpacker.co.uk>

It's been a while, but I've got to a point where I feel able to make
another release.

The one to watch out for the the schema change - not an issue if you are
starting fresh, but if you have any users you will find it problematic
if email addresses are not unique.

Parley 0.09 Changes:
    - make email column unique
	  ** this may cause problems if you already have a large amount of user data **
	- added lost password functionality in
	  Controller::User::LostPassword
	- factored signup functionality out into Controller::User::SignUp
	- start moving towards use of <fieldset> instead of <table> for form
	  layout
	- use a floating loginbox instead of a separate screen (as inspired
	  by calendarhub.com)
	- added visual feedback when TZ preference is updated
	- show time-formatting sample in my/preferences
	- store the referer when visiting my/preferences making it easier to
	  return to where we were previously
	- added about/modules, an easier way to obtain version information
	  for loaded modules
	- modify log-in check in auto() to use Auth::DBIC calling style
	- use ConfigLoader plugin to load application config
	- add authed_user() function, and alter instances of
	  $c->session->{authed_user} accordingly
	- added new function to Parley::App::Helper -
	  application_email_address()
	- update dependencies/versions in Makefile.PL
	- added Template::Plugin::ForumCode (not all BBCode functionality is
	  complete yet)
	- use ForumCode plugin to process various display elements
	- email from-address for emails is now set in config file
	- new helper function application_email_address()
	- small layout fixes
	- change name of session file
	- ammend statusbar and post-edit templating to work correctly with
	  new storage location of authed_user object
