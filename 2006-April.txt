Subject: [Parley-announce] Parley is still alive
Message-ID: <20060406095414.GB11923@herlpacker.co.uk>

Just to let you (all) know that Parley is still alive and well.

I took a small break to focus on some model photography and to take a
short holiday, but now I'm back and semi-actively looking at Parley
again.

In the last day or two I've:

 - exported the Parley section of my home repository to the project at
   Berlios [https://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=5999]
 - totally reinstalled perl, and upgraded to Catalyst 5.66 and
   DBIx::Class 0.6.0
 - modified a small amount of code so that logged in user work properly
   with the latest DBIx::Class
 - checked in a number of outstanding updates
 - added a mailing list for SVN commit messages

I've not reached a point where I'm happy enough to roll-out 0.09, but
Parley hasn't been abandoned.

Regards,

Chisel
